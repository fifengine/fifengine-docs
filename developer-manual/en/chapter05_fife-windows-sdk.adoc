## Fife Windows SDK

The Fife Windows SDK is a collection of software development tools for working with Fifengine.

The Fife SDK installer build scripts fetch all required packages for working with fifengine, 
including build-tools and dependencies, prepares them for packaging and finally builds the "SDK" installer on Appveyor.

This chapter documents these build scripts and tasks, including fetching and extracting components and compiling the InnoSetup installers.

### Repository Overview

### Appveyor

We are using Appveyor to continuously build and publish the installer.
The file `appveyor.yml` is Appveyor's configuration file.
Important are the sections `before_build`, `build_script`, `artifact`, `deploy`.

### Before Build Tasks (before_build)

Before we can build the installer, we need to download and extract 
the software components, which we later want to include in the installer.
After the extraction, we copy and move some files and folders around.
Then we delete several unnecessary files and folders in a stripdown run.

At the end of the `before_build` step, we have a proper folder structure
with all the components we want to ship, ready for inclusion into the installer.

### Building the Installer (build_script)

The installer is build using the InnoSetup Compiler (`iscc`).

The property `APP_VERSION` is set from the APPVEYOR environment as `%APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION%`, 
so that the installer is dynamically versionized from the outside.

`build-tools\innosetup\iscc /DAPP_VERSION=%APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION% installer\fife-sdk.iss`

The target location for installer is: `fife-windows-sdk\_build`.

The compiled setup executable has the following naming scheme: `{#APP_NAME}-{#APP_VERSION}-Setup-{#APP_COMPILER}-x86`, 

for example: `_build\FifeSDK-0.4.0-Setup-VC14-x86.exe"`

#### Debugging the installer

- You can create a log of the installation procedure by using the `/LOG` CLI argument.

    FifeSDK-0.4.0-Setup-VC14-x86.exe /LOG=c:\fifesdk.log

### Artifact Upload (artifact)

When the installer was successfully build, it is automatically published on Appveyor's artifact storage.

### Downloads (deploy)

When a new release version of the installer is tagged, then the installer is automatically published on Github Releases.
