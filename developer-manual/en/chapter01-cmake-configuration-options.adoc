=== CMake

CMake is a "meta build system" that reads a description of the project written in the CMakeLists.txt files 
and emits a build system for that project of your choice using one of CMake's "generators". 

This allows CMake to support many different platforms and build tools. 
You can run `cmake --help` to see the list of supported "generators" on your platform.

=== CMake Build Types

Several build types are supported.

- Release
- Debug
- RelWithDebInfo
- MinSizeRel

For the single configuration generators (e.g. "Unix Makefile" and "Visual Studio 12 2013"") you set the build type when invoking cmake by passing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build_type>` where `<build_type>` is one of the build types specified above.

For multi-configuration generators (e.g. Visual Studio) you don't set the build type when invoking CMake 
and instead set the build type within Visual Studio itself (by using the dropdown in the top navigation bar).

=== CMake configuration options

There are three groups of configuration options:

- **CMake's own config options**: The `CMAKE_*` flags allow to declare useful build variables, including locations, environment variables, compiler information and compiler flags. 
You find more details in the https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables[CMake Wiki - Useful Variables].

- **Fifengines's config options**:We provide several configuration flags, which allow configuring the fifengine build.
They control which subsystems/components of fifengine to build.
You find the overview in the https://github.com/fifengine/fifengine/blob/48aee046979afe740f8b15323c777c595a8e7ab7/CMakeLists.txt#L25[CMakeLists file].

- **Config options for finding dependencies**: Finally, we have `*_INCLUDEDIR` + `*_LIBRARY_DIR` flags. 
These are used to set the paths to the headers and lib folder for dependencies.

[NOTE]
====
We are guiding CMake to find the dependencies automatically.
The default location for dependencies is a folder `fifengine-dependencies` next to the `fifengine` source folder.
The FifeSDK installs the dependencies by default into this location.

If the dependencies are placed into a folder of your choice, you need to give the paths to each 
dependencies to CMake. Either by declaring them on the CLI by using the `*_INCLUDEDIR` + `*_LIBRARY_DIR` flags
or by using the CMake-Gui and selecting the folders.

`cmake ..\fifengine`:: We are building in a seperate build folder: the `fifengine-build` folder, project source is one up, then down into fifengine. This is called out-of-source-tree building. 

`-G %GENERATOR%`:: You need to specifiy the requested GENERATOR IDE. This is either `"Visual Studio 14"` or `"Mingw makefiles"`. Others values are possible. See CMake generators for more.

`-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\fifesdk\fifengine-dependencies\include"`:: where the includes are

`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=%CONFIGURATION%`:: Release or Debug

`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\fifesdk\fife-install"`:: the installation folder, after build

`-DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR="C:\fifesdk\fifengine-dependencies\include\boost"`:: helper to find boost

`-DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="C:\fifesdk\fifengine-dependencies\lib\boost"`:: helper to find boost

`-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\fifesdk\python\include"`:: helper to find Python

`-DPYTHON_LIBRARY="C:\fifesdk\python\libs\python27.lib"`:: helper to find Python

`-DSWIG_DIR=C:\fifesdk\swig`:: helper to find Swig folder

`-DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=C:\fifesdk\swig\swig.exe`:: helper to find Swig executable

`-DSDL2_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\fifesdk\fifengine-dependencies\include\SDL2"`:: helper to find SDL2 headers

`-DSDL2_LIBRARY_DIR="C:\fifesdk\fifengine-dependencies\lib\x86"`:: helper to find SDL2 library

`-Dbuild-library=ON`:: This build flags enables building the shared library (ON). When disabled (OFF), then only the Python extension is build.

`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`:: This build flag controls, whether to build a shared (ON) or static library (OFF).
